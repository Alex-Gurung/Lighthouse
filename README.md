# Lighthouse (Hackathon Project)

![Lighthouse logo](logo.png)

**Lighthouse** is an react-native (currently android only) app to allow people in crises like those of terrorist attacks and natural disasters find a place to stay quickly by connecting them with people who would like to host.

## Status
After HackTJ-2017, **Lighthouse** has a useable interface, that has working guest and host forms, as well as an automated alert to the guest if there is an available host.

## Future
Places we think need improvement are: 
* Improve the UI for quicker and smoother interaction
    * The splash screen in particular
* SMS automation so that guests can send off an automated message to the host
* Location(possibly with google maps) automation to give them automatic directions (will require some work on the backend)
